  <h1><center> My name is Emmanuel</center> </h1>
  <p> I am a student at Wake Tech, in the <b>Computer Programming and Development</b> program.
      For this semester, I am currently taking this class, <i> Web, Programming, and Database Foundations</i>, along with <i>Public Speaking</i>. Since I am trying to become a prestigious electronic music producer, I spend almost all of my free time making music (or sometimes just weird sounds). I am enjoying this class. The hardest (or rather, most time-consuming) part of this class for me has been getting Mermaid to look the way I wanted it to, and the ChatGPT questions and answers. <br><br> By the way, even though the paragraph CSS and the h1 CSS foreground colors look the same, they are, in fact, different colors.</p>
